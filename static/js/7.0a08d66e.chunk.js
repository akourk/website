I am particularly interested in projects that touch on health and social impact.\n\n# Currently\n\nI am currently looking for new opportunities as a Software Engineer.\n\n# Some history\n\n- My mom had a computer in her shop where I would wait after elementary school for her to finish work. It ran Windows 3.0. My favorite games were Lemmings, The Oregon Trail, and Minesweeper.\n\n- Eventually we subscribed to AOL. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk. I remember waiting hours for a song to download on Napster.\n\n- I loved gaming, starting with the NES, to the Game Boy, then eventually back to PC games like Age of Empires and Command & Conquer.\n\n- At 13, I broke my nose by kneeing myself in the face on the trampoline. That was the last front flip I'll ever attempt.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike, Diablo II, Warcraft III, and World of Warcraft.\n\n- At 18, I enrolled in my local community college and changed my major too many times to count. I found passion in learning about health and fitness, and briefly majored in Physical Therapy.\n\n- I became certified and spent the next 12 years working as an athletic trainer. I've made life-long friendships and cherished memories in the gym.\n\n- After reading a few philosophy books, I decided it's what I wanted to study. At 22, I transferred to Evergreen State College to focus on Philosophy.\n\n- At 24, I graduated, but I wasn't finished learning. I continued as an athletic coach while enrolled in math classes on the side.\n\n- At 26, I adopted my best friend, and sidekick, [Molly.](https://github.com/akourk/website/blob/main/public/images/molly.jpg?raw=true)\n\n- At 27, I enrolled in Bellevue College's first B.S. in Computer Science cohort.\n\n- At 29, I enrolled in the [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) Piscine, and a month later was accepted into their full-time program.\n\n- At 30, in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, I graduated from Bellevue College.\n\n# I like\n\n- Coffee\n- Dogs\n- Philosophy\n- Meeting new people\n- Reading\n- Olympic-Style Weightlifting, CrossFit, and Health\n- Music and nice headphones ([Sennheiser HD650](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/high-quality-headphones-around-ear-audio-surround-hd-650), [Schitt](https://www.schiit.com/))\n- Mechanical pencils ([rotring](https://www.rotring.com/us/))\n- Podcasts ([The Partially Examined Life](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- Good design ([Dieter Rams](https://us.gestalten.com/products/less-and-more-dieter-rams))\n\n# I aspire to\n\n- always find inspiration.\n- keep learning.\n- do better.\n- help others.\n\n# Websites I enjoy\n\n- [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)\n- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)\n- [Vitalik Buterin](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin)\n- [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)\n- [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(o.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Alex Kourkoumelis",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(s.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
