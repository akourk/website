I enjoy building systems that make people\u2019s lives better\u2014especially projects that intersect with health, sustainability, and social impact.\n\n# Currently\n\nI'm exploring new opportunities as a Software Engineer where I can contribute to meaningful, well-crafted products and grow alongside thoughtful teams.\n\n# Background\n\nI\u2019ve taken a somewhat unconventional path into software, and I\u2019m grateful for it. I grew up on an old Windows 3.0 machine, spent my teenage years breaking and fixing computers, and eventually found myself coaching athletics, studying philosophy, and wandering through the worlds of nutrition, kinesiology, and physical therapy before committing fully to Computer Science.\n\nAlong the way:\n\n- I coached for over 15 years and became a certified CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, helping grow a small gym into a thriving community.\n\n- I earned a B.A. in Philosophy from Evergreen State College, which continues to shape how I think about systems, people, and the ethics of technology.\n\n- I later joined Bellevue College\u2019s first B.S. in Computer Science cohort and completed additional coursework at 42 Silicon Valley.\n\n- For my senior project, I worked with the non-profit **WattTime**, building global emissions data pipelines used to support carbon-curving initiatives.\n\n- I joined **Microsoft** as a Security Analyst, focusing on large-scale signal analysis, abuse detection, and improving algorithmic accuracy.\n\n- I\u2019m currently a **Lead Software Engineer at State Farm**, helping modernize customer-facing insurance policy tools across legacy and modern platforms.\n\nThrough all of this, I\u2019ve always been driven by the same things: curiosity, a desire to understand how systems work, and a commitment to helping people\u2014whether that\u2019s through software, coaching, or education.\n\n# I like\n\n- Coffee\n- Dogs\n- Philosophy\n- Meeting new people\n- Reading\n- Olympic-Style Weightlifting, CrossFit, and Health\n- Music and nice headphones ([Sennheiser HD650](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/high-quality-headphones-around-ear-audio-surround-hd-650), [Schitt](https://www.schiit.com/))\n- Mechanical pencils ([rotring](https://www.rotring.com/us/))\n- Podcasts ([The Partially Examined Life](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), and others)\n- Clean, functional design ([Dieter Rams](https://us.gestalten.com/products/less-and-more-dieter-rams))\n\n# I aspire to\n\n- keep learning\n- do better\n- help others\n\n# Websites I enjoy\n\n- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)\n- [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)\n- [Vitalik Buterin](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin)\n- [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)\n- [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\n- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/)\n",d=h.split(/\s+/).map(e=>e.replace(/\W/g,"")).filter(e=>e.length).length,u=e=>{let n=Object.assign({},((0,a.A)(e),e));return(0,c.jsx)(o.N_,(0,i.A)({},n))},p=()=>(0,c.jsx)(l.A,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Alex Kourkoumelis",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(o.N_,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(r(),{source:h,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}]);
