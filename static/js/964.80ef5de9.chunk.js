It ran Windows 3.0. My favorite games were Lemmings, The Oregon Trail, and Minesweeper.\n\n- At 18, I enrolled in my local community college and changed my major too many times to count. I found passion in learning about health and fitness, and briefly majored in Physical Therapy.\n\n- I became certified and spent the next 15 years working as an athletic trainer. I've made life-long friendships and cherished memories in the gym.\n\n- After reading a few philosophy books, I decided that's what I wanted to study.
