I am currently looking for new opportunities as a Software Engineer.

# Some history

- My mom had a computer in her shop where I would wait after elementary school for her to finish work. It ran Windows 3.0. My favorite games were Lemmings, The Oregon Trail, and Minesweeper.

- Eventually we subscribed to AOL. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk. I remember waiting hours for a song to download on Napster.

- I loved gaming, starting with the NES, to the Game Boy, then eventually back to PC games like Age of Empires and Command & Conquer.

- At 13, I broke my nose by kneeing myself in the face on the trampoline. That was the last front flip I'll ever attempt.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike, Diablo II, Warcraft III, and World of Warcraft.

- At 18, I enrolled in my local community college and changed my major too many times to count. I found passion in learning about health and fitness, and briefly majored in Physical Therapy.

- I became certified and spent the next 12 years working as an athletic trainer. I've made life-long friendships and cherished memories in the gym.

- After reading a few philosophy books, I decided it's what I wanted to study. At 22, I transferred to Evergreen State College to focus on Philosophy.

- At 24, I graduated, but I wasn't finished learning. I continued as an athletic coach while enrolled in math classes on the side.

- At 26, I adopted my best friend, and sidekick, [Molly.](https://github.com/akourk/website/blob/main/public/images/molly.jpg?raw=true)

- At 27, I enrolled in Bellevue College's first B.S. in Computer Science cohort.

- At 29, I enrolled in the [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) Piscine, and a month later was accepted into their full-time program.

- At 30, in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, I graduated from Bellevue College.
