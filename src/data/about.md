# Intro

I am a Computer Science and Philosophy graduate in the Seattle area. I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and social impact.

# Currently

I am currently looking for new opportunities as a Software Engineer.

# Some history

- My mom had a computer in her shop where I would wait after elementary school for her to finish work. It ran Windows 3.0. I'd sit and tinker for hours. My favorite games were Lemmings, The Oregon Trail, and Minesweeper.

- Eventually we subscribed to AOL. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk. It took years for me to send my first email.

- I loved gaming, starting with the NES, to the Game Boy, then eventually back to PC games like Age of Empires and Command & Conquer.

- 12 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike, Diablo II, Warcraft III, and World of Warcraft.

- At 18, I enrolled in my local community college and then changed my major too many times to count. I found passion in learning about health and fitness, and briefly majored in Physical Therapy.

- I got certified and began working as an athletic trainer while continuing my studies. I continued as an athletic trainer for 12 years.

- After reading a few philosophy books, I decided that's what I wanted to study. In 2012, I transferred to Evergreen State College to focus on Philosophy.

- In 2014, I graduated, but I wasn't done learning. I continued as an athletic coach while enrolled in math classes on the side.

- In 2016, I adopted my best friend, and sidekick, [Molly.](https://github.com/akourk/website/blob/main/public/images/molly.jpg?raw=true)

- In 2017, I enrolled in Bellevue College's first B.S. in Computer Science cohort.

- In the summer of 2019, I enrolled in the [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) Piscine, and a month later was accepted into their full-time program.

- In 2020, in the midst of the global covid pandemic, I graduated from Bellevue College!

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
