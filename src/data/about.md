# Intro

I'm a Software Engineer based in the Seattle area. I enjoy building systems that make people’s lives better. Especially projects that intersect with health, sustainability, and social impact.

# Currently

I'm always exploring new opportunities as a Software Engineer where I can contribute to meaningful, well-crafted products and grow alongside thoughtful teams.

# Background

I’ve taken a somewhat unconventional path into software, and I’m grateful for it. I grew up on an old Windows 3.0 machine, spent my teenage years breaking and fixing computers, and eventually found myself coaching athletics, studying philosophy, and wandering through the worlds of nutrition, kinesiology, and physical therapy before committing fully to Computer Science.

Along the way:

- I coached for over 15 years and became a certified CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, helping grow a small gym into a thriving community.

- I earned a B.A. in Philosophy from Evergreen State College, which continues to shape how I think about systems, people, ethics, and technology.

- I later joined Bellevue College’s first B.S. in Computer Science cohort and completed additional coursework at 42 Silicon Valley.

- For my senior project, I worked with the non-profit **WattTime**, building global emissions data pipelines used to support carbon-curving initiatives.

- I joined **Microsoft** as a Security Analyst, focusing on large-scale signal analysis, abuse detection, and improving algorithmic accuracy.

- I’m currently a **Lead Software Engineer at State Farm**, helping modernize customer-facing insurance policy tools across legacy and modern platforms.

Through all of this, I’ve always been driven by the same things: curiosity, a desire to understand how systems work, and a commitment to helping people, whether that’s through software, coaching, or education.
